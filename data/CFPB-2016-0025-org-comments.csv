Re: Comments on proposed rulemaking on payday, vehicle title, and certain high-cost installment loans  
Docket number CFPB-2016-0025 or RIN 3170-AA40 
  
Dear Director Cordray:
  
The Oregon Center for Public Policy (the ""Center"") files this comment in response to the CFPB's proposed rule on payday, vehicle title, and certain high cost installment loans. Thank you for the opportunity to submit comments. The rule is a critical first step in preventing the harms of unaffordable loans, but the rule must be strengthened to ensure it stops the debt trap once and for all.

The Center is a nonprofit, nonpartisan research institute that aims to advance policies that improve economic and social opportunities for all Oregonians, particularly low- and moderate-income Oregonians. One of our successes is helping curtail the predatory payday loan industry in Oregon. A decade ago, the Center's research showed Oregon had more payday lenders than McDonald's and 7-Elevens combined. 
 
In Oregon, even with our protections, the debt trap payday and car title loans cause is still harming Oregonians. On a $300, two-week payday loan, payday lenders typically charge 154 percent.  Annually, these high cost lenders drain about $6,580,000 in payday fees and $10,100,000 in car title fees from Oregon consumers.  Much of this comes from the pockets of Oregon veterans and communities of color, populations that the payday and car title lenders target and exploit. Payday lenders' ability to seize money directly out of borrowers' bank accounts, and car title lenders' ability to threaten repossession of a borrower's car, means that people are left with little choice but to re-borrow, becoming more deeply mired in a cycle of debt. The CFPB's rule would help these borrowers by beginning to rein in predatory lending practices.
  
The core principle of the CFPB's proposal is the right approach  requiring lenders to ensure that a loan is affordable to the borrower without having to re-borrow or default on other expenses. This is critically important to stopping the harm caused by the predatory business model, and we strongly support this approach.
 
This basic principle, though, must be applied to every loan, with no exceptions and no room for future evasion. As currently written, the proposed rule contains loopholes that significantly undermine this standard. For example, in Oregon, the proposal would allow six 154 percent APR payday loans per year to be made without any ability-to-repay standard. This is six unaffordable loans too many. In addition, the rule exempts longer term payday loans with high origination fees from its proposed ability-to-repay test. These loopholes must be closed.
 
We are also concerned that the proposed rule does not go far enough to prevent the flipping of borrowers from one unaffordable loan to the next. The CFPB should do more to ensure that short-term debt doesn't become unaffordable long-term debt. It should ensure a 60-day cooling off period, rather than just 30 days as proposed, between each short-term loan. It should also ensure that short-term loan indebtedness doesn't exceed a total of 90 days every 12 months, consistent with FDIC 2005 guidelines for its banks. In addition, it is critically important to strengthen the protections against repeat refinancing of longer-term loans. If lenders can repeatedly flip borrowers from one long-term loan into another, debt will continue to pile up and borrowers will once again be stuck in a debt trap.
  
Finally, the rule must be strengthened to ensure that people have enough money to live on after paying back the loan. Right now, the proposal falls short in this regard. Lenders should be required to use an objective measure for projecting a borrower's basic living expenses and avoid over-reliance on back-end measures like default and re-borrowing rates. Even low default rates are not sufficient evidence of ability to repay, given the lender's ability to coerce repayment through control over the borrower's bank account or car. 
 
We are thankful that one loophole has already been closed - an exemption from the proposed ability to repay test if loan payments are less than 5 percent of a borrower's income, a provision included in the Bureau's preliminary outline. We are pleased that this exemption has been dropped, since examining income alone is not enough to determine if a loan is affordable. 

We call on the CFPB to close the remaining loopholes and issue the strongest rule possible to stop the harmful debt trap of unaffordable payday loans.


Sincerely,   



Chuck Sheketoff

James Patterson, Partnership of African American Churches","DearDirectorCordray,

The Partnership of African American Churches files this comment in response to the CFPB's proposed rule
on payday, vehicle title, and certain high cost installment loans. Thank you for the opportunity to submit
comments. The rule must be strengthened to ensure that a weak rule does not undermine the strong
combination of laws that has long been enacted in West Virginia. The Partnership of African American
Churches (PAAC) is a 501c3 nonprofit organization located in Charleston West Virginia. PAAC's
mission is to work as an agent of empowerment is communities of color in West Virginia, by programmatic
implementation and positive policy change. Currently there are twenty-one congregations affiliated with
thisinitiative.

Due to our strong interest rate cap, people in our state are protected from the harms of the typical 300% APR payday and car title loans. We appreciate that the CFPB clearly stated in the proposed rule that states with rate caps, such as ours, provide stronger protection than what the rule can provide. However, we are concerned that the weaknesses in the proposed rule will be seen as the CFPB sanctioning these harmful loans that our state does not allow. The loopholes in the proposed rule must be closed to ensure that the CFPBproposaldoesnotundermineourstateprotectionsagainsthigh-costlending.

Our experiences demonstrate that people are better off without these harmful, highcost and unaffordable payday loans. We see every day that people have other options besides falling into the payday lenders' debt trap.

Annually, our citizens save $86,286,184 that would otherwise be spent on fees to float unaffordable payday and car title loan debt. The savings from our rate cap benefit not only individual people and communities but the state economy as a whole. While the CFPB's rule will be critical in states that have yet to pass a rate cap,aratecaphasbeenthemosteffectiveprotectionfrompredatorylendingpractices.

We call on the CFPB to issue a rule without exceptions and without loopholes. While we will continue to enforce the rate limits in our state, we also call on the Bureau to declare that loans made in violation of our statelawsareunfair,deceptive,andabusive.

Although not as strong as our state interest rate cap, which we understand the CFPB lacks the authority to establish, the core principle of the CFPB's proposal is the right approach - requiring lenders to simply ensure that a loan is affordable without having to reborrow or default on other expenses. In light of the CFPB's inability to set a rate cap, a strong abilitytorepay test is critically important. This basic principle though must be applied to every loan - with no exceptions and no room for future evasion. As currently written, the proposed rule contains dangerous loopholes to this standard. For example, the proposal allows six 300% APR payday loans a year to be made without any ability-to-repay determination. This is six unaffordable loans too many. In addition, the rule exempts longer-term payday loans with high origination
feesfromitsproposedability-to-repaytest.Theseloopholesmustbeclosed.

We are also concerned that the proposed rule does not go far enough to stop borrowers from flipping one unaffordable loan to the next. The CFPB should do more to ensure that short-term debt does not become unaffordable long-term debt. It should ensure a 60-day cooling off period, rather than just 30 days as proposed, between each short-term loan. It should also ensure that short-term loan indebtedness doesn't exceed a total of ninety days every twelve months, consistent with FDIC 2005 guidelines for its banks. In addition, it is critically important to strengthen the protections against repeat refinancing of longer-term loans. If lenders can repeatedly flip borrowers from one long-term loan into another, debt will continue to pileupandborrowerswillonceagainbestuckinadebttrap.

Finally, the rule must be strengthened to ensure that people have enough money to live on after paying back the loan. Right now, the proposal falls short in this regard and may allow lenders to simply continue ""business as usual."" Lenders should be required to use an objective measure for projecting a borrower's basic living expenses and avoid over-reliance on back-end measures like default and reborrowing rates.

Even low default rates are not sufficient evidence of ability to repay, given the lender's ability to coerce repayment through control over the borrower's bank account or car title. At the same time, the Bureau should take care not to sanction industry-wide high rates of defaults and reborrowing by comparing one paydaylender'sdefaultratesonlytootherpaydaylenders'defaultrates.

Annually, these high cost lenders drain $30,807,055 in payday fees and $65,414,558 in car title fees, a significant loss both to borrowers and to the overall state economy.  Furthermore, a large proportion of borrowers are continuously mired in the debt trap, as 58% of loans are reborrowed on the same day that a previous loan is repaid, and 85% are reborrowed within 60 days of repayment of the previous loan.  This is particularly detrimental to Idaho's 121,172 veterans and communities of color, populations which the payday and car title loan industries target and exploit.

Covenant House files this comment in response to the CFPB's proposed rule on payday, vehicle title, and certain high cost installment loans. Thank you for the opportunity to submit comments. The rule must be strengthened to ensure that a weak rule does not undermine the strong combination of laws that has long been enacted in West Virginia. Covenant House was founded in 1981 to help people with the fewest resources meet their basic needs: food, clothing, and shelter. After 36 years, our core mission remains the same. Whether a person is homeless, facing eviction, or needs food for their table, Covenant House is a safety net, an advocate, and a safe haven in times of crisis.
Due to our strong interest rate cap, people in our state are protected from the harms of the typical 300% APR payday and car title loans. We appreciate that the CFPB clearly stated in the proposed rule that states with rate caps, such as ours, provide stronger protection than what the rule can provide. However, we are concerned that the weaknesses in the proposed rule will be seen as the CFPB sanctioning these harmful loans that our state does not allow. The loopholes in the proposed rule must be closed to ensure that the CFPB proposal does not undermine our state protections against high-cost lending. 
Our experiences demonstrate that people are better off without these harmful, high-cost and unaffordable payday loans. We see every day that people have other options besides falling into the payday lenders' debt trap. 
Annually, our citizens save $86,286,184 that would otherwise be spent on fees to float unaffordable payday and car title loan debt.  The savings from our rate cap benefit not only individual people and communities but the state economy as a whole. While the CFPB's rule will be critical in states that have yet to pass a rate cap, a rate cap has been the most effective protection from predatory lending practices. We call on the CFPB to issue a rule without exceptions and without loopholes. While we will continue to enforce the rate limits in our state, we also call on the Bureau to declare that loans made in violation of our state laws are unfair, deceptive, and abusive. 
Although not as strong as our state interest rate cap, which we understand the CFPB lacks the authority to establish, the core principle of the CFPB's proposal is the right approach - requiring lenders to simply ensure that a loan is affordable without having to re-borrow or default on other expenses. In light of the CFPB's inability to set a rate cap, a strong ability-to-repay test is critically important. This basic principle though must be applied to every loan - with no exceptions and no room for future evasion. As currently written, the proposed rule contains dangerous loopholes to this standard. For example, the proposal allows six 300% APR payday loans a year to be made without any ability-to-repay determination. This is six unaffordable loans too many. In addition, the rule exempts longer-term payday loans with high origination fees from its proposed ability-to-repay test. These loopholes must be closed. 
We are also concerned that the proposed rule does not go far enough to stop borrowers from flipping one unaffordable loan to the next. The CFPB should do more to ensure that short-term debt does not become unaffordable long-term debt. It should ensure a 60-day cooling off period, rather than just 30 days as proposed, between each short-term loan. It should also ensure that short-term loan indebtedness doesn't exceed a total of ninety days every twelve months, consistent with FDIC 2005 guidelines for its banks. In addition, it is critically important to strengthen the protections against repeat refinancing of longer-term loans. If lenders can repeatedly flip borrowers from one long-term loan into another, debt will continue to pile up and borrowers will once again be stuck in a debt trap. 
 Finally, the rule must be strengthened to ensure that people have enough money to live on after paying back the loan. Right now, the proposal falls short in this regard and may allow lenders to simply continue ""business as usual."" Lenders should be required to use an objective measure for projecting a borrower's basic living expenses and avoid over-reliance on back-end measures like default and reborrowing rates. Even low default rates are not sufficient evidence of ability to repay, given the lender's ability to coerce repayment through control over the borrower's bank account or car title. At the same time, the Bureau should take care not to sanction industry-wide high rates of defaults and reborrowing by comparing one payday lender's default rates only to other payday lenders' default rates.

Re: Housing Equality Law Project (HELP) comments on proposed rulemaking on payday, vehicle title, and certain high-cost installment loans, Docket number CFPB-2016-0025 or RIN 3170-AA40   

Dear Director Cordray,  

Housing Equality Law Project (HELP) is a private non-profit civil rights agency dedicated to the elimination of housing discrimination, the promotion of housing choice and the creation of inclusive communities of opportunity.  HELP is located in the San Francisco Bay Area and serves the entire State of California with a focus on serving communities deemed ""un-served or underserved"".  

Payday lending may be quick fixes for unexpected financial emergencies, but in reality create unaffordable debt traps.  These loans are designed to create the need for repeat usage, racking up damaging amounts of debt.  The San Francisco Bay Area's outrageous cost of housing has contributed to an increase of borrowers who are forced into a cycle of borrowing and re-borrowing just to cover the shortfall created by the previous loan.  

Due to the unaffordable terms payday loans carry, many borrowers are forced into a cycle of borrowing and re-borrowing just to cover the shortfall created by the previous loan.


The core principle of the CFPB's proposal is the right approach: lenders should be required to ensure that a loan is affordable without having to re-borrow or default on other expenses. This rule is critically important to stopping the harms of this predatory business model, and we strongly support this approach. We urge you to apply this basic principle to every loan - with no exceptions and no room for future evasion. 

Unfortunately, the proposed rule contains dangerous loopholes that significantly undermine this standard. For example, the proposal could allow six, 400% APR payday loans a year to be made without any ability to repay standard. This is six unaffordable loans too many.  In addition, the rule exempts longer-term payday loans with high origination fees from its proposed ability to repay test. These loopholes must be closed.  

We are also concerned that the proposed rule does not go far enough to prevent lenders from flipping or churning borrowers from one unaffordable loan to the next. The CFPB should do more to ensure that short-term debt doesn't become unaffordable long-term debt. It should ensure a 60 day cooling off period between each short-term loan, rather than just 30 days as proposed. It should also ensure that short-term loan indebtedness doesn't exceed a total of 90 days every 12 months, consistent with FDIC 2005 guidelines for banks. Longer-term loans should be presumed to be unaffordable if the borrower has to refinance to avoid default or if the loan is refinanced before 75% of the loan principal is paid. Lenders should be prohibited from refinancing longer-term loans a second time.

The rule must be strengthened to ensure that people have enough money for living expenses after paying back the loan. Lenders should be required to use an objective measure for projecting a borrower's basic living expenses and avoid over-reliance on backend measures like defaulting and re-borrowing; even lenders with supposed low default or re-borrowing rates should be required to assess ability to repay since lenders often have direct access to borrowers' bank accounts and have the ability to ensure they get paid before the borrower can pay other expenses. 

Finally, all loans where the lender has leverage to coerce payment or reborrowing must be covered by the ability to repay rule. All loans secured by access to a bank account, a car title, the ability to garnish wages, or similar security should be covered, regardless of when security is taken.

Thank you for the opportunity to submit comments. The rule is a critical first step in stopping the harms that unaffordable loans cause, and the rule must be strengthened to ensure it stops the debt trap once and for all. 

Sincerely,

Mary Prem

Dear Director Cordray:

I am writing to urge the CFPB to reinstate proposed limitations on payday, title and installment loan products that would limit monthly payments to 5% of monthly income on loans with APRs of 36% or higher.

High cost lenders claim that there is no way to provide credit to low credit score borrowers without charging triple digit interest rates.  They cite high default rates and the high cost of doing business as insurmountable hurdles to lower cost loans.  They are wrong.

The true driver of triple digit APRs is not irresponsible customers, or high costs; it is irresponsible high cost business models.  Listed below are five existing lending small lending programs that prove affordable loans can be made to low credit/ low income borrowers at a profit.

Kashable provides affordable loans to low credit borrowers as turnkey employee benefit.  They make loans ranging from 6-26% APR to borrowers with credit scores as low as the 400's with quick online applications and funding in 3 days.  It costs employers nothing to offer this benefit.

Employee Loan Solutions has an employee benefit model similar to Kashable, but does no credit check and funds loans in a day.  Their APR is 24.9%.  Again, no cost to employers. 

Both employee loan solutions, and kashable use the stability of the employer's workforce as an underwriting tool by offering loans to folks who have been employed at least six months and taking repayment through payroll deductions.  Because employees are made aware of the loan programs through company employee benefits communications, the lender does not bear the cost of maintaining low volume storefronts, and expensive TV, radio, mailer and telemarketing programs.  Default rates hover at around 2%.   

Programs like Employee Loan Solutions and Kashable are ideal for government agencies and the military where turnover is low and up to 20% of employees use expensive payday, title and installment loans.  Government would do well to implement these programs both for the benefit of its workers and to set an example for the private sector.

Opportun is a CDFI serving spanish speaking customers in California, Arizona and Texas that does loans for 36% APR or less.

SECU in North Carolina is a large credit union that provides small loans for as little as 12%, and GECU in El Paso Tx, provides 26% no credit check quick turnaround loans.  They have fast turnaround low documentation models that operate at high volume and rely on credit union membership to minimize defaults.

Gradually implementing a 5% of income payment rule on loans over 36% would not kill the small loan business.  It would push the business into efficient business models that better serve customers and the community.  I would advise adding an inflation adjuster to the 36% APR figure to account for potential hyper inflationary periods like the one that led to the gutting of usury laws in the early 1980's.

Finally, I want to point out that small dollar installment lenders that claim they do responsible underwriting are almost always lying. 

I am attaching loan information for Louis Gomez, a borrower I worked with in Las Cruces, New Mexico.  When I met him, he had loans from six different outfits.  After loan payments, his monthly cash flow was reduced to $170, and most of his meals were from soup kitchens and food donation programs.  Yet, as you will see, all six of the lenders pushed for loan refinancing whenever loan balances dipped.  They pushed Louis from poverty to destitution.  What are the odds that all six of them would continue their aggressive marketing tactics given Louis' situation?  These abuses are not exceptions, they are standard industry practice.

Thanks for your attention.

Re: Essie Justice Group comments on proposed rulemaking on payday, vehicle title, and certain high-cost installment loans, Docket number CFPB-2016-0025 or RIN 3170-AA40   

Dear Director Cordray,  

Essie Justice Group is a nonprofit in Oakland, CA, dedicated to harnessing the power of women with incarcerated loved ones. Using a Healing to Advocacy model, we're building a loving and powerful community of women committed to improving the lives of the 1 in 4 American women who have a family member in prison.
In 2015, Essie served as a part of the Research Team for the Who Pays report, a national participatory action research project that revealed the true cost of mass incarceration on women and families who support loved ones behind bars. In its key findings, it was reported that 1 in 3 survey participants had to take out a loan just to cover phone and visitation costs, and that 1 in 5 took out loans to pay court-related costs. 83% of the family members primarily responsible for these costs were women.

Essie Justice Group is concerned about any financial product that would prey on families struggling desperately to maintain contact with loved ones inside. We support the CFPB's efforts to protect these consumers from predatory lending schemes designed to put families into permanent cycles of high-interest debt.
An organization we trust, the California Reinvestment Coalition, has advised us that the core principle of the CFPB's proposal is the right approach: lenders should be required to ensure that a loan is affordable without having to re-borrow or default on other expenses. This rule is critically important to stopping the harms of this predatory business model, and we strongly support this approach. We urge you to apply this basic principle to every loan - with no exceptions and no room for future evasion. 

Unfortunately, the proposed rule contains dangerous loopholes that significantly undermine this standard. For example, the proposal could allow six, 400% APR payday loans a year to be made without an ability to repay standard. This is six unaffordable loans too many.  In addition, the rule exempts longer-term payday loans with high origination fees from its proposed ability to repay test. These loopholes must be closed.  

We are also concerned that the proposed rule does not go far enough to prevent lenders from flipping or churning borrowers from one unaffordable loan to the next. The CFPB should do more to ensure that short-term debt doesn't become unaffordable long-term debt. It should ensure a 60 day cooling off period between each short-term loan, rather than just 30 days as proposed. It should also ensure that short-term loan indebtedness doesn't exceed a total of 90 days every 12 months, consistent with FDIC 2005 guidelines for banks. Longer-term loans should be presumed to be unaffordable if the borrower has to refinance to avoid default or if the loan is refinanced before 75% of the loan principal is paid. Lenders should be prohibited from refinancing longer-term loans a second time.

The rule must be strengthened to ensure that people have enough money for living expenses after paying back the loan. Lenders should be required to use an objective measure for projecting a borrower's basic living expenses and avoid over-reliance on backend measures like defaulting and re-borrowing; even lenders with supposed low default or re-borrowing rates should be required to assess the ability to repay since lenders often have direct access to borrowers' bank accounts and have the ability to ensure they get paid before the borrower can pay other expenses. 

Finally, all loans where the lender has leverage to coerce payment or re-borrowing must be covered by the ability to repay rule. All loans secured by access to a bank account, a car title, the ability to garnish wages, or similar security should be covered, regardless of when security is taken.

Essie Justice Group is against any decision which would have adverse impacts on the economic security of low-income communities, people of color, and women and families with incarcerated loved ones. It is our understanding that this rule is a critical first step in stopping the harms that unaffordable loans cause our constituency and the rule should be strengthened to ensure it stops the debt trap.
